Matthias was a fabulous host, made sure we had everything we needed, gave us fantastic recommendations for the locality and gave us a street name for the perfect starting point for our early morning climb to the 'sign'.",

The bed is comfortable and the neighborhood is quiet.  It's a short walk to South Congress which is also great.  And of course, the chickens outside the front door are the icing on the cake.",
